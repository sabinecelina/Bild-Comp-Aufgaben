# Assignment #02 - Height measurement

## Task 

Implement a script with Python and OpenCV that calculates the height of an object given a reference object placed on the same plane. Given three exemplary images (images\table_bottle_*.jpg) of a table showing two objects - a bottle and a mug. The bottle has a height* of 26 cm. Calculate the height of the mug in cm. Write a readme file that explains what you have done and how to run the script and what the script does.

* measured by hand as no official source found for the bottle dimensions.

#### Write a script that allows manually selecting the needed image points for the calculation. (2 points)
